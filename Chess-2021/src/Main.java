public class Main {

//    Create a game of Chess for two players.
//    You will need to create a Class of the board.
//    In this you will set out limitations.
//    You will need to create a piece Class
//    Piece class will then need to be extended to different types of piece.
//    Will you need to create a move class. Including fundamentals about a move.
//    Move Class will then need to be extended as per the piece class.
//    Perhaps interface is better that inheritance as you can only inherit once...

//    <><><><><><> POTENTIAL FURTHER IDEAS ><><><><><><><>
//    A note pad or linked list to record the game. (This would allow a List iterator to navigate back through positions?
//    A timer?
